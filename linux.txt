    Internal Commands	    Built into the shell (e.g. Bash), no separate executable file. Fast, always available.
    External Commands	    Stored as separate binaries (usually in /bin, /usr/bin). Run by calling the binary.

    SHELLS : A shell is a command-line interpreter. It takes the commands you type and passes them to the Linux kernel to execute.

    Main Types of Shells
    Shell	                            Path (usually)	        Description
    Bourne Shell (sh)	                /bin/sh	                The original Unix shell; basic and fast
    Bash (Bourne Again Shell)	        /bin/bash	            Most popular; default on many systems
    Zsh (Z Shell)	                    /bin/zsh	            Advanced features, customization, oh-my-zsh themes
    Korn Shell (ksh)	                /bin/ksh	            Combines features of sh and csh; used in enterprises
    C Shell (csh)	                    /bin/csh	            C-like syntax, mostly historical
    Fish (Friendly Interactive Shell)	/usr/bin/fish	        Modern, user-friendly with syntax highlighting
