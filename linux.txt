    TYPE OF Commands

    ================================================================================================================
    Type	                Description
    Internal Commands	    Built into the shell (e.g. Bash), no separate executable file. Fast, always available.
    External Commands	    Stored as separate binaries (usually in /bin, /usr/bin). Run by calling the binary.

    SHELLS : A shell is a command-line interpreter. It takes the commands you type and passes them to the Linux kernel to execute.

    Main Types of Shells
    Shell	                            Path (usually)	        Description
    Bourne Shell (sh)	                /bin/sh	                The original Unix shell; basic and fast
    Bash (Bourne Again Shell)	        /bin/bash	            Most popular; default on many systems
    Zsh (Z Shell)	                    /bin/zsh	            Advanced features, customization, oh-my-zsh themes
    Korn Shell (ksh)	                /bin/ksh	            Combines features of sh and csh; used in enterprises
    C Shell (csh)	                    /bin/csh	            C-like syntax, mostly historical
    Fish (Friendly Interactive Shell)	/usr/bin/fish	        Modern, user-friendly with syntax highlighting


echo $SHELL                 // To know which shell is in use

chsh                        // To change the shell

alias dt=date               // Setting an alias for dat command

#

    ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

env                         // To display all variables in the shell environment.

echo $SHELL                 // To display value stored in a single variable.
echo $LOGNAME

export OFFICE=Caleston      // To set value of a variable.
OFFICE=Caleston             // Variable value set only for the current session.

    ~/.profile
    or
    ~/.pam_environment      // To make the values of variables permanent over reboots, set them in the user profile.

#

    PATH VARIABLE
    When a user issues an external command into the shell, the shell uses a path variable to search for these external commands.

echo $PATH                  // To see the directories defined in the $PATH variable.
                            NOTE : If the path variable does not have the location of a command or a program defined, running a command by itself will result in a failure.

which obs-studio           // To check if the location of a command (obs-studio) can be identified.
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/obs/bin // To add the path of a command (obs-studio) in $PATH environment variable.
which obs-studio            // It should display the path [opt/obs/bin/obs-studio] as output.


#

    BASH PROMPT
    It shows the logged in user and host systems details, it is editable.

[user@hostname]$        // This can be like [michael@prod-server]$
                        // $ is a User Prompt Symbol

    The bash prompt is controlled by special shell environment variables, one common one is PS1.
    PS1 : Prompt definition, the variable that defines what your terminal prompt looks like in bash.

    üß± 1Ô∏è‚É£ Basic printable characters

    You can use any normal text (letters, numbers, punctuation, emojis, etc.) directly in PS1.

    Example:
    PS1="Hello > "

    Produces:
    Hello >


    ‚úÖ Allowed:

    Letters: a-z A-Z

    Numbers: 0-9

    Symbols: !@#$%^&*()[]{}<>?/|;:'",.=-+_

    Emojis and Unicode (‚úÖ e.g. PS1="üêß \u@\h \$ ")


    üß© 2Ô∏è‚É£ Backslash escapes (special \ sequences)

    These are special placeholders Bash replaces dynamically.

    Here‚Äôs the full list (from the official Bash manual):

    üé® 3Ô∏è‚É£ ANSI color codes and formatting

    You can include ANSI escape codes to add color and style.
    You must wrap them in \[ \] to tell Bash they don‚Äôt take up screen space.

    Example	            Description
    \[\e[0m\]	        Reset all colors
    \[\e[31m\]	        Red text
    \[\e[32m\]	        Green text
    \[\e[33m\]	        Yellow text
    \[\e[34m\]	        Blue text
    \[\e[1m\]	        Bold
    \[\e[4m\]	        Underline

    Example:

    PS1="\[\e[1;32m\]\u@\h\[\e[0m\]:\[\e[1;34m\]\w\[\e[0m\]\$ "

    ‚Üí Shows green user@host, blue directory, and resets after.


    ‚öôÔ∏è 4Ô∏è‚É£ Variable and command substitutions

    You can embed shell variables or even commands in your prompt.

    üßÆ Variables:
    PS1="[$USER@$HOSTNAME] "


    ‚Üí [alice@debian]

    ‚ö° Command substitution:
    PS1="\u@\h:\$(date +%H:%M)\$ "


    ‚Üí alice@debian:14:43$

    (Note: use \$() not backticks, and escape $ if needed.)


    üß† 5Ô∏è‚É£ Conditional or dynamic parts

    You can include Bash expressions like:

    PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\u@\h:\w\$ '


    ‚Üí Only prints ($debian_chroot) if that variable is set.


    ‚ö†Ô∏è 6Ô∏è‚É£ What NOT to do

    ‚ùå Don‚Äôt forget to wrap non-printing sequences (color codes) with \[ \].

    Otherwise, line wrapping breaks.

    ‚ùå Don‚Äôt use raw control characters (except through escapes).

    ‚ùå Avoid very long or slow command substitutions ‚Äî they‚Äôll make your prompt lag.


    ‚úÖ 7Ô∏è‚É£ Example: A fancy colored PS1

    PS1='\[\e[1;32m\]\u@\h\[\e[0m\]:\[\e[1;34m\]\w\[\e[0m\]\[\e[1;33m\] $(date +%H:%M:%S)\[\e[0m\]\$ '


    Might look like:

    alice@debian:/home/alice/projects 14:45:12$

    (with username green, path blue, time yellow)
#

echo $PS1
\[\]\[\e]0;\u@\h: \w\a\]${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]\$ \[\]

    
    1Ô∏è‚É£ What is $PS1?

    $PS1 is the primary prompt string ‚Äî it tells Bash what to display when waiting for a command.

    If $PS1 contains \u@\h:\w\$ , your prompt might look like:

user@hostname:/home/user$

    
    2Ô∏è‚É£ Let‚Äôs decode your PS1 step by step

SEGMENT 1: \[\]\[\e]0;\u@\h: \w\a\]

    \e = ESC (start of an escape sequence)

    ]0;... = set terminal window title

    \u = current username

    \h = hostname (first part before .)

    \w = current working directory

    \a = BEL character (ends the title-setting command)

    \[ and \] = mark ‚Äúnon-printing characters‚Äù (so Bash can correctly handle cursor position and line wrapping)


    üß† So this portion sets your terminal title bar (not the visible prompt line).

    ‚úÖ Example:
    If your user is alice, host is debian, and you‚Äôre in /home/alice/projects,
    your terminal window title (the title bar, not the prompt) becomes:

    alice@debian: /home/alice/projects


SEGMENT 2: ${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}

    ${var:+value} means: if $var is set and non-empty, substitute value; otherwise, substitute nothing.

    So:

    If you are inside a Debian chroot environment (e.g. /etc/debian_chroot exists), this shows something like (chrootname)

    Otherwise, nothing is displayed.

    ‚úÖ Example:
    If $debian_chroot=‚Äúbuster‚Äù, this part becomes:

    (buster)


SEGMENT 3: \[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]

    This sets colored text for username@hostname.

    \033 = ESC (same as \e)

    [01;32m = bright green text

    \u@\h = username@hostname

    [00m = reset color to default

    ‚úÖ Example:
    Appears as:

    alice@debian

    (in green)


SEGMENT 4: :

    Just a literal colon separating the hostname from the working directory.


SEGMENT 5: \[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]

    Same color pattern:

    \033[01;34m = bright blue

    \w = current directory (full path, but with ~ for home)

    \033[00m = reset color

    ‚úÖ Example:

    If you are in /home/alice/projects, this appears as:

    /home/alice/projects

    (in blue)


SEGMENT 6: \$

    \$ = prints # if you are root, $ if you are normal user

    = a space for readability

    ‚úÖ Example:

    $

    (for regular user)
    or

    #

    (for root)


SEGMENT 7: \[\]

    These empty \[ \] pairs mark the end ‚Äî they don‚Äôt change anything; just delimit non-printing characters.

    ‚úÖ Final Output Example

    If:

    user = alice

    host = debian

    directory = /home/alice/projects

    not in chroot

    normal user

    You‚Äôll see:

    alice@debian:/home/alice/projects$ 


    With:

    alice@debian in green

    /home/alice/projects in blue

    $ in default color

    Terminal window title set to ‚Äúalice@debian: /home/alice/projects‚Äù

    What the Kernel Does
    ======================

    Here are its main jobs (in plain language):

    Manages memory ‚Äì decides how RAM is used and shared among apps.

    Controls processes ‚Äì starts, stops, and schedules programs (CPU scheduling).

    Handles hardware ‚Äì communicates with the CPU, disks, keyboard, etc., through device drivers.

    Manages system calls ‚Äì lets apps safely ask the OS to do things (like read a file or send data).

#

    How It Works (Step-by-step Example)
    =====================================

    Let‚Äôs say you click ‚ÄúSave‚Äù in a text editor.

    App (user program) says:

    ‚ÄúHey OS, please save this file!‚Äù

    Library translates that request into a system call.

    Kernel takes over:

    Finds space on the disk,

    Writes the data,

    Updates the file system.

    Hardware (disk) does the actual writing.

    So the kernel makes sure everything happens safely and correctly ‚Äî no app directly touches hardware.

#

    Why it looks confusing
    ------------------------

    Historically:

    Before 2003, Linux used a three-number scheme (2.6.32 ‚Üí major.minor.patch).

    Now it‚Äôs two main numbers (major.minor), and the rest are patch/build identifiers.

    So for:
    
    6.6.87.2


    you can think of it as:
    Kernel 6 (major) ‚Üí Minor 6 ‚Üí Patch 87 ‚Üí Local revision 2

#

    How WSL2 adds extra info
    -------------------------

    Microsoft compiles its own Linux kernel for WSL2, and appends:

    -microsoft-standard-WSL2


    That‚Äôs not part of the Linux versioning scheme ‚Äî it just tells you this kernel was built and tuned for Windows Subsystem for Linux 2.

#

    EXAMPLE - Connecting a USB drive to PC
    ---------------------------------------

STEP 1: Physical Connection (Hardware Layer)

    - You insert the USB stick into the port.

    Hardware
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ USB Connector ‚Üí USB Controller (chip on motherboard)


    - The USB controller detects a new electrical signal ‚Äî

    it notifies the CPU that a new USB device is connected via a hardware interrupt.


 STEP 2: Kernel Interrupt Handling (Kernel Space)

    - When the hardware interrupt fires:

    The CPU switches into kernel mode.

    The USB subsystem in the Linux kernel gets the signal.

    The kernel loads or activates the correct USB driver.

    Example kernel modules involved:

    usbcore.ko        ‚Üê Core USB support
    xhci_hcd.ko       ‚Üê USB 3.0 controller driver
    usb_storage.ko    ‚Üê Generic USB mass storage driver
    sd_mod.ko         ‚Üê SCSI disk module (for storage devices)


    - The kernel now treats the USB stick like a block device and assigns it a name like /dev/sdb.


 STEP 3: Device Initialization (Kernel Space)

    The kernel:

    Reads the USB device descriptor (metadata about the device).

    Allocates resources (buffers, endpoints).

    Registers the new device in /sys (sysfs) and /dev.

    You can see this with:

dmesg | tail                    // To display messages from an area of the kernel called the ring buffer, it contains hardware logs created durting kernel loading.
dmesg | grep -i usb

    You‚Äôll get logs like:

    [1234.567890] usb 2-1: new high-speed USB device number 4 using xhci_hcd
    [1234.678901] usb 2-1: New USB device found, idVendor=0781, idProduct=5567
    [1234.789012] scsi 6:0:0:0: Direct-Access     SanDisk  Ultra 16GB 1.00 PQ: 0 ANSI: 6
    [1234.890123] sd 6:0:0:0: [sdb] 30535680 512-byte logical blocks


    - At this point, the kernel fully recognizes the USB stick and exposes it to user space as /dev/sdb.

 STEP 4: User Space Detection

    - In user space, background services like udev or systemd-udevd detect the new device event from the kernel.

    They:

    Create a device file in /dev/ (like /dev/sdb1).

    May automatically mount it (on desktop systems) using tools like udisks2 or gvfs.

    You can see it:

lsblk


    Output:

    sdb     8:16   1  14.5G  0 disk 
    ‚îî‚îÄsdb1  8:17   1  14.5G  0 part  /media/user/USB


 STEP 5: Mounting (User Space + Kernel Space)

    When you or the system mounts the drive:

    sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/usb


    Here‚Äôs what happens:

    User space command mount (binary) runs.

    It makes a system call to the kernel‚Äôs VFS (Virtual File System) layer.

    The kernel loads the correct filesystem driver (e.g., vfat.ko, exfat.ko, ntfs.ko).

    The kernel reads the filesystem metadata and connects it to /media/usb.

    Now the drive is accessible.


STEP 6: Using the Drive (User Space ‚Üî Kernel Space)

    When you open or copy a file:

    User-space apps (cp, cat, file explorer) request reads/writes via system calls (read(), write()).

    The kernel filesystem layer translates those requests into block I/O.

    The USB storage driver sends data over the USB bus to/from the drive.

    User Space
    ‚Üì
    System Calls (read/write)
    ‚Üì
    Kernel Space
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ VFS ‚Üí Filesystem driver (FAT, NTFS)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Block layer
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ USB storage driver
    ‚Üì
    Hardware (USB Controller ‚Üî USB Drive)


STEP 7: Safely Removing the Drive

    When you click ‚ÄúEject‚Äù or run:

sudo umount /media/usb


    User-space command umount calls kernel‚Äôs VFS to unmount.

    The kernel:

    Flushes any cached data to disk,

    Releases file handles,

    Notifies the USB driver subsystem.

    Once idle, the USB driver signals the controller ‚Äî safe to remove.


#

    UDEV
    =====
    udev (userspace /dev) is the device manager for the Linux kernel, operating in user space. It handles the dynamic creation and removal of device nodes in the /dev directory.

    Responsibilities of udev:
    --------------------------

    Creates/removes device files under /dev dynamically when hardware is added/removed.

    Applies permissions and ownership to devices.

    Creates symlinks (like /dev/disk/by-uuid/).

    Loads firmware if needed.

    Runs user-defined scripts or actions when a device is detected (via udev rules).

    
    Example use case:

    When you plug in a USB drive:

    Kernel detects it and emits a udev event.

    udev listens for these events and:

    Creates the device node (e.g., /dev/sdb).

    Applies rules (e.g., setting permissions, running a script).

    Optionally triggers auto-mount (if configured via other subsystems).


#

    UDEVADM
    ========
    udevadm is the administrative tool to interact with the udev daemon. Think of it as the command-line interface to inspect, control, and debug udev.

    Common udevadm commands:

    Command	                        Purpose
    udevadm info	                Query udev database for device information.
    udevadm trigger	                Manually trigger udev events.                       // Useful after modifying udev rules to test them without rebooting.
    udevadm settle	                Wait for all current events to finish.
    udevadm monitor	                Watch udev events in real-time. (Listens to kernel uevents)
    udevadm control	                Modify udev daemon behavior (e.g., reload rules).
    udevadm control --reload-rules  Reload udev rules


#

    Where are the udev rules?
    --------------------------

    System rules: /usr/lib/udev/rules.d/

    Admin/custom rules: /etc/udev/rules.d/

    Udev rules have filenames like 10-local.rules or 99-usb.rules and define match-action pairs.

#

    LSPCI
    ======
    lspci is a command-line tool in Linux used to list all PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect) devices on your system.

    It's part of the "pciutils package" and provides details about hardware devices connected to the PCI bus such as such as graphics cards, network cards, USB controllers, sound cards, ethernet cards, RAID controllers, video cards, directly attached wireless adapters

    PCI -> Peripheral Component Interconnect


     What is the PCI bus?
     ---------------------

    The PCI bus is a hardware bus used for attaching peripheral devices to a computer's motherboard. Common on desktops, laptops, and servers.


     What does lspci do?
     --------------------

    It reads from:

    /sys/bus/pci/devices/

    /proc/bus/pci/

    And uses the PCI ID database to translate numeric IDs into human-readable names.


    Basic Usage:
    -------------

    Command             Description
    lspci               View all PCI devices
    lspci -v            Get detailed info (verbose)

    LSBLK
    ======
    lsblk (List Block Devices) is a command-line utility in Linux used to list information about block devices ‚Äî like hard drives, SSDs, USB drives, partitions, and loop devices.

    It's part of the "util-linux" package and is commonly used for inspecting storage devices and their structure.

    Basic Usage

lsblk

    Example output:

NAME   MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
sda      8:0    0  500G  0 disk 
‚îú‚îÄsda1   8:1    0  100G  0 part /
‚îú‚îÄsda2   8:2    0  300G  0 part /home
‚îî‚îÄsda3   8:3    0  100G  0 part [SWAP]

    Here:

    sda is a disk

    sda1, sda2, sda3 are partitions

    Mounted at /, /home, and swap

    Common Options
    Command	            Description
    lsblk -f	        Show filesystem info (type, UUID, label)
    lsblk -a	        List all devices (including empty ones)
    lsblk -d	        Only show top-level disks (not partitions)
    lsblk -e 7	        Exclude loop devices (major number 7)
    lsblk -o            NAME,SIZE,FSTYPE,MOUNTPOINT	Customize columns
    lsblk -J	        JSON output (useful for scripts)


    Bonus Tip: Combine with blkid

    lsblk is great for hierarchy and mount info.

    blkid shows detailed filesystem metadata (UUIDs, labels, types).

    MAJOR-MINOR NUMBER and DEVICE TYPE
    =============================

    What is a Major Number?

    The Major Number in Linux identifies the driver associated with a device.

    When the kernel sees a device, it uses the major number to know which kernel module (driver) should handle that device.

    Example:

$ ls -l /dev/sda
brw-rw---- 1 root disk **8, 0** Oct 18 10:00 /dev/sda

    b ‚Üí Block device
    8 ‚Üí Major number ‚Üí Identifies the disk driver (sd for SCSI disks)
    0 ‚Üí Minor number ‚Üí Identifies the specific device (e.g., partition or disk)


    Major vs Minor Number
    ----------------------

    Number Type	            Meaning
    Major	                Identifies the device driver
    Minor	                Identifies the specific instance of the device the driver controls


    Common Major Numbers
    ---------------------
    Major Number	        Device Type
    8	                    SCSI/SATA disks (sd)
    1	                    RAM disk (/dev/ram*)
    3	                    IDE hard drives (hd)
    7	                    Loop devices (/dev/loop*)
    180	                    USB devices
    202	                    Xen virtual block device
    254	                    Device mapper (e.g., LVM)

    You can see a full list in /proc/devices:
    cat /proc/devices


#

    What is a Device Type?
    =======================

    Device types tell Linux how to interact with the device:

    Type	            Description
    b	                Block device ‚Äì reads/writes data in blocks (e.g., disks, USB drives)
    c	                Character device ‚Äì reads/writes data as a stream (e.g., keyboards, serial ports)
    p	                FIFO/pipe ‚Äì for inter-process communication


    Example:

$ ls -l /dev/tty0
crw--w---- 1 root tty 4, 0 Oct 18 10:00 /dev/tty0

c ‚Üí Character device
4 ‚Üí Major (TTY driver)
0 ‚Üí Minor


#

    LSCPU
    ======
    lscpu is a Linux command-line utility that displays CPU architecture information.
    It's a quick way to inspect details about the system‚Äôs processor(s) ‚Äî such as cores, threads, sockets, CPU family, virtualization support, and more.

    It pulls information from /proc/cpuinfo and sysfs.


    What does lscpu show?
    -----------------------

    Here‚Äôs a sample output:
    Architecture:            x86_64
    CPU op-mode(s):          32-bit, 64-bit
    Byte Order:              Little Endian
    CPU(s):                  8
    On-line CPU(s) list:     0-7
    Thread(s) per core:      2
    Core(s) per socket:      4
    Socket(s):               1
    Vendor ID:               GenuineIntel
    Model name:              Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8650U CPU @ 1.90GHz
    Virtualization:          VT-x
    L1d cache:               32K
    L2 cache:                256K
    L3 cache:                8192K


    Key Fields Explained:

    Field	                Meaning
    Architecture	        CPU architecture (e.g., x86_64, aarch64)
    CPU(s)	                Total number of logical processors (threads)
    Thread(s) per core	    Indicates hyperthreading (2 = enabled)
    Core(s) per socket	    Physical cores per CPU
    Socket(s)	            Number of physical CPUs (usually 1 in laptops/desktops)
    Model name	            CPU branding info
    Virtualization	        Whether virtualization is supported (e.g., VT-x, AMD-V)
    Caches	                Sizes of L1, L2, L3 CPU caches


    Example Use Cases
    
    Command                 Description
    lscpu                   Show CPU layout
    lscpu -J                Display info in JSON format
    lscpu --parse=NUMA      Show NUMA info (if applicable)
    lscpu | grep '^CPU(s)'  Show only specific fields


#

    Difference vs /proc/cpuinfo
    ----------------------------

lscpu:              Structured, high-level summary (uses sysfs)

/proc/cpuinfo:      Raw per-CPU core details (e.g., flags, bugs)

Use cat /proc/cpuinfo if you need flags like sse4_2, vmx, aes, etc.
